## Introduction
This repository is the implementation of our Tiling Puzzle Solver Project ([UVA CS6161 Algorithm](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/cs6161/)). Our algorithm is based on Dr. Donald Knuth's Dancing Links Algorithm, which can be found [here](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jchu/publicportal/sudoku/0011047.pdf). It solves an Exact Cover situation, so it can be extended to a variety of applications that need to fill constrains, such as this Tiling Puzzle Solver problem.
